## Description

Matcha is your typical dating website, but with cats.

This website allows users to create an account, complete their personal profile (with auto-geolocalisation) and select criteria for their ideal mate. Users then get recommendations that match those criteria or they can search for profiles by age, popularity, localisation and interests. They can like one another (and view who liked them), report fake profiles, block other users, or chat if they both liked each other. These actions impact users' public popularity scores and/or generate notifications. See [matcha.fr.pdf](../master/matcha.fr.pdf) for details.
